### Context:
The happiness of a country can be derived by multiple factors. Happiness has proven to be of an immense contribution to a country’s development.

The Happiness Index, with a scale ranging from 1 to 10, is a score that measures the well-being of citizens of a certain country.  In this report, 6 of the most important factors contributing to the happiness have been analysed and visualised. GDP, Health expectancy, social support, generosity, freedom and corruption give us valuable insights about the “happy” state of mind of the country. 

This analysis takes the reader through some overall graphs to establish a certain overview and later on goes more into depth by comparing some interesting subjects. 

The data used for this report comes forth out of the World Happiness report which is an initiative to track global happiness. The data was gathered from the [World Happiness Report 2018 website](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/).
